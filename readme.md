# Toy Tanks!!!!!

Toy Tanks was a game created by myself as my phase 3 project at the Flatiron School. The inspriartion came from the Wii Play Tanks game I used to play as a kid. Please read the instructions blow and have fun playing!

Here is a blog post where I discuss the tank movementin detail.

The objective of the game is to destroy all of the enemy tanks and touch the green finish marker to make it to the next level. There are a total of 5 levels each with increasing difficulty.
